    <p>When thinking about the next design we observed other bridges worked well with a rounded top. So we decided to work that into our design and chose a camelback design. This is what our template looked like. </p>

    <p> We learned from our previous bridge that you donâ€™t need to pile on the spaghetti  for the whole bridge. We applied that idea to our bridge and cut down the amount of spaghetti to only 3 pieces for areas in compression and 2 for tension.
When building the trusses out for the bridge we made a mistake on the second truss. The truss was off the design by quite a bit and that would bring our score down quite a bit. We needed to remake the whole truss. We had to be very careful about the amount of spaghetti, and glue sticks as the supplies were already low.

    <p> our bridge had a failure mode of joint failure on the abutments and held up 2.800 kg or 6 pounds.</p>

     <p>While building the third truss we found that doing the outline of the truss made it a lot easier to build the rest of the bridge and be almost exact to the template. We will be bringing that technique to the third and final design.</p>
