    <div><h6>Camelback Truss Design</h6></div>
    <div><h6>Our Design with spaghetti</h6></div>
</div>
<p> In the first round of testing, the curved truss bridges performed the best. For this reason, we decided to try a camelback truss design for our second bridge. Because our last bridge was too heavy, we used fewer spaghetti layers. We used 3 spaghetti strands in areas with compression and 2 spaghetti strands in areas with tension. To better meet the size requirements, we also lowered the height, length and width of our bridge.
</p>
<p>This time, our bridge successfully met the size requirements, achieving a total  score of 22.5. This was a big improvement compared to our previous score of 16.3. Despite our progress, our second bridge broke due to joint issues in the bottom corner of the bridge, which affected its stability and performance. Because this failure mode doesn't say much about the strustural integrity of our bridge, we tested it again after re-gluing the bottom corner.
</p>
<p>In our third design, we plan to make the spahgetti strands shorter to reduce the chance of them breaking under compression.
